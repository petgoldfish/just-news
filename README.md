# Just News
With the many distractions, ads, and other data on typical news sites, it can get overwhelming pretty quickly. That motivated me to build this news app that shows just the news!

~See it in action [here](https://just-news.netlify.app/).~ Unfortunately, News API has restricted their free tier to only work on localhost so the live demo is broken. You can still run it locally, however, to get a look at it in action.

Initially started off with Javascript and then moved to Typescript for type safety and development peace of mind.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
